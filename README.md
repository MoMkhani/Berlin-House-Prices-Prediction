Berlin used to be an affordable place not so long ago. When I moved to Berlin, my uncle was paying around 580 euros for a one-bedroom apartment in the Mitte neighborhood. From there, you could walk through history, art, and culture without even taking a bus. Things have changed since then. Berliners not only need to compete between thousands of applications to find a place, but also they need to pay hefty rents to secure what they want. 

I want to investigate this matter and answer some questions. More importantly, I decided to make a machine learning model predicting the rent prices in Berlin using different features. Since there are not many public datasets about berlin house prices available out there, I used a kaggle dataset. [This dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/corrieaar/apartment-rental-offers-in-germany) contains apartment rental offers in Germany from the dates 2018-09-22, 2019-05-10, and 2019-10-08 (Collected from [immobilienscout24](https://www.immobilienscout24.de)). I filtered out Berlin listings to work on it exclusively.

The berlin dataset is available on my [Github](https://github.com/MoMkhani/Berlin-House-Prices-Prediction/blob/main/Data/berlin.csv).

* Gathered berlin listings from immobilienscout24, validated and cleaned data
* Performed an exploratory data analysis and answered different questions about the berlin real state market
* Built machine learning models to predict rent prices in berlin using regression techniques
